# JLC Culture of Manhood Blueprint

## What Does That Mean?

- **JLC** is an organization with spiritual leadership under Journey Life Church
- **Culture** is both the structural and organic expression of values. When values are declared, culture facilitates their experience at every internal and external interface
- **Manhood** is the description and declaration of the implicit identity of men by the Lord
- **Blueprint** is an outline of what is being built—the outcome and the materials to make it happen

## Manhood

> A man is the Father's compassionate design, His crafted vessel, for the world to experience His goodness.

Being a man means we are called to know the Father in a way that we become an expression of Him. A culture of manhood develops men who are an expression of the Father in every facet of their life—personally, in their marriages, with their kids, in community, in leadership, in service, in every area of influence.

## The Three Levels of Invitation

### 1. The Open Invitation

A low barrier to entry that sets the bar for intentionality, responsibility, and encounter.

**Characteristics:**
- **Open** to all men who are curious, newly born, or seeking the Lord
- **Consistent** — making space often for people to connect and go deeper
- **Compassionate** — uncompromising truth wrapped completely in the fruit of the spirit
- **Purposeful** — a clear direction; not an endpoint, but a starting point

**What it looks like:**
- A space where we declare openly the values of manhood and celebrate those who model them
- We share struggles and victories
- A taste of faithfully living in connection with the Father
- It's not about pancakes or throwing axes—it's about celebrating and modeling biblical manhood in every facet of our lives

**The Values We Model:**
- Remaining in the hands of Jesus, like a child, though we represent His strength on the earth
- Continuous pursuit of our spouses, a deep adoration that models Jesus' love of us
- Humble, prayerful, & creative fathering and parenting
- Excellence in our personal lives—not ego nor perfection, but a humble pursuit of wholeness
- Stewardship, excellence, leadership, and creative heaven-sent innovation in our professional expression
- Responsibility and service in our community

### 2. Invitations to Intentionality

The Church is God's people together experiencing and becoming an expression of His goodness and kindness. A culture of manhood takes ownership of each space and finds potent and powerful expressions in each.

**Relationship Types (by quantity and intimacy):**

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| **1:1** | Marriage (most intimate), Discipleship/Partnership, Brotherhood, Friendship, Kindness in community |
| **Intimate Groups (3-5)** | Family, Boat Crews, Teams |
| **Community Groups (6-15)** | Neighbors, Small Groups |
| **Connected Communities** | Neighborhoods, Shared Interest Groups, Men's/Women's groups |

**Standards for Intentional Community:**
1. **Never solo** — have a team initiating
2. **Clear invitations are healthy** — clarity prevents dissolution under pressure
3. **Having oversight is best** — someone praying for and guiding the community
4. **Titles are cheap. Leadership is essential.** — everyone expects to serve and grow

### 3. Invitations to Intimacy

The smallest, most tight-knit relationships where individual training, coaching, and discipleship takes place.

**What this produces:**
- Men who mentor and are mentored
- A "swim-buddy" for hard times, big wins, or vulnerable moments
- Men who raise up the next generation and are humbly learning from the youth

## Building Culture

> Culture is not built at the pace of business, it is built at the pace of community.

### How Culture is Formed

1. **What we celebrate and what we accept**
2. **The stories we tell and retell**
3. **What happens between declaring our core values and having others experience them**

### To Build a Culture of Manhood:

- Celebrate true manhood, accept individual efforts and journeys, not tolerate the counterfeit
- Tell and listen to stories about manhood
- Declare the values of manhood and observe and recreate the experience of them

## Key Principles

> The same materials that build a beautiful trellis that facilitates year over year growth, can also be used to create a roof and eventually a cage that prohibit sunlight and limit growth.

- **Observe growth, don't force it** — take one or two steps at a time
- **Don't advertise an outcome** — guide the step faithfully and let God do the work
- **Culture must grow organically** — organizational leaders cannot control culture, but must let it grow and tend it carefully
- **Not rushing is essential** — culture needs to be both intentional and organic, structured and free-flowing
