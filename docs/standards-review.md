# Standards Review

A personal reflection on the values of manhood.

---

## The Maturity Framework

For each standard, growth follows this pattern:

**Awareness** → **Desire** → **Priority** → **Consistency & Discipline** → **Integration**

---

## Intimacy

> Personal connection with the Lord

### What It Is

Intimacy is being with someone enough to see them, and sharing myself enough to be seen. The primary ingredient is dedicated time every day where it is just the Lord and myself without distraction.

### Three Aspects of Connection

| Metaphor | Meaning | Practice |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **Breathing** | Continual need for God to live | Mindful of His presence throughout the day—thankful, joyful, prayerful |
| **Food** | Daily nourishment to be strong | Reading the Word, listening for God's voice, encouraging yourself with what you read and hear |
| **Water/Wine** | Refreshment and courage | Experienced most often in community and worship |

### Scripture

- **John 10:14-15** — "I know my sheep and my sheep know me—just as the Father knows me and I know the Father."
- **John 15** — "Abide in me."

### Key Insight

> Consistency and discipline is not the same as "religious." The spirit of religion isn't about what you do, but why you do it. Religion tells us we need to do things to be "enough"—consistency and discipline says we do things because of who we are and their value to us.

---

## Identity

> What the Father says about me

### What It Is

Identity grows from the soil of intimacy. When I spend time close to the Lord, I am allowing Him to speak new life over me. While I think I know who I am, I have a bastardized view of myself that the Lord is continually redeeming and restoring.

### The Glory of Identity

The glory in hearing my identity from the Lord is when I live from it—when I live courageously aligned to who He says I am, and not bending to the whims of circumstance.

### Maturity in Identity

- **Young believers** — building awareness and language for identity
- **Growing believers** — walking through trials and testing that forge identity
- **Older believers** — unwavering in any circumstance; Character = forged identity (Romans 5:3-5)

### Scripture

- **John 1** — "Through him all things were made"
- **Psalm 139** — "You knit me together in my mother's womb"
- **Romans 12:2** — "You are transformed by the renewing of your mind"

### Key Insight

> Words are worthless unless we are renewed and transformed by them. Identity isn't meant to be quoted in convenience—it's meant to be lived regardless of circumstance.

---

## Integrity

> Living without compromise, no matter the cost

### Three Types of Integrity

1. **Moral integrity** — societal construct
2. **Biblical integrity** — Jesus's higher standard (don't just avoid murder, guard your words; don't just avoid adultery, guard your heart)
3. **Integrity to identity** — responding to and honoring the unique invitations from the Lord to live from who He says I am

### The Distinction

> Sacrifice is often required to move forward—giving something of value that you have the right to give. Compromise is giving something you have no right to give.

### Maturity in Integrity

The struggle in many people's faith walk is a misunderstanding of God's intention to bring people into integrity to their identity—character. Salvation is a starting point not a finish line, and the end result is not that you look like "Jesus" as he walked the earth, but that you become the true expression of yourself—the one he declared at the earth's foundation.

### Scripture

The narrative of scripture from the beginning:
- Adam and Eve — one basic instruction, an invitation to trust
- Israelites — 10 commandments and infrastructure for society
- Moses to Jesus — those raised into integrity over time fare better than those thrust into authority

---

## Leadership

> How we invest in, learn from, and lead in every sphere

### What It Is

> I am a Leader that will follow you.

As a leader, I look not only at where you are, but where you've been and where you are going. I seek to understand my role in proclaiming your destiny with you. I will not limit your expression with my vision, but will contribute to your becoming with all that I am.

### Four Spheres

| Sphere | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Husband** | Sacrificial love—I am my beloved's and she is mine |
| **Father** | Brilliant and creative—my children will go beyond me |
| **Worker** | Work as worship (avodah) and stewardship (shamar) |
| **Community** | Responsibility and compassion in every sphere of influence |

### Key Insight

> Leadership does not require authority. To be effective in authority, you must be a good leader, but you do not need authority to be a great leader.

> The essence of leadership is where we are leading from and where we are leading people towards. The key ingredients to maturity in leadership stem from identity and wisdom.

### Word from the Lord (February 13, 2023)

> The lack of leadership you are experiencing in your cities and nations is because men are feeling "called" from the spirits of "need" and "ambition," but Heaven is not moved by need or ambition. Heaven flows from overflow, from glory to glory, from levels of obedience and authority that lead to increased levels of obedience and authority.

## Fruitfulness

> Fruit that lasts

### What Is Fruit?

- **Fruit has to last** — beyond our lives, beyond earth, into heaven
- Money, leadership, promotion by themselves are not fruit
- Faith, hope, and love will last
- Fruit comes from connection to the Vine, cultivated by the Gardener
- Multiplication matters (parables of talents and minas)
- The Fruits of the Spirit are part of a fruitful soul

### Three Levels of Fruitfulness

1. **Successful** — leveraging gifts to produce and increase value
2. **Uncompromising** — refusing to compromise values even at the cost of success; accepting seasons of pruning
3. **Conquering** — identity forged, calling is nothing more than following Jesus each day—through seasons of battle, through seasons of building, always from rest

### Scripture

- **John 15** — the axioms of fruitfulness
- **Mark 11** — Jesus curses the fruitless fig tree

### Key Insight

> There is no valuable measure of fruitfulness except to do the will of the Father. Any attempt to justify fruitfulness another way is foolish.

---

## Trials

> The testing that forges character

### What It Is

Following Jesus includes trials and suffering. The gap between what Jesus and scripture declares as Kingdom, and what is happening on the earth, is a place that can only be traversed in worship—believing God is who He says He is and can do what He says He can do, no matter our current situation.

### Types of Trials

- **Consequence** — natural results of poor decisions (immaturity)
- **Training** — testing of faith that builds character
- **Conquering** — inheriting promises through endurance

### Scripture

- **Romans 5:3-5** — "Suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope."
- **James 1:2-4** — "Consider it pure joy... the testing of your faith produces perseverance."

---

## Inheritance

> Heaven on earth

### What It Is

The Lord moves through inheritance. What one person does faithfully is meant to bless generations. An inheritance is not something you earn—it is something you receive because of who you are. It is directly tied to identity.

### The Process

> Suffering produces perseverance, perseverance, character, and character, hope. And hope does not put us to shame, because God's love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit.

The only thing that can end in hope is what starts with a word from Jesus—His word never returns void. What we hear Jesus speak to us, our identity, is worth suffering for. Character is the foundation for hope, and hope is a lightning rod for heaven.

### Key Insight

> My inheritance comes from Jesus speaking to who I am and me living that courageously.
