# A Culture of Manhood at Journey Life Church

*Staff Introduction — February 2024*

---

## How Did We Get Here?

On January 15th, 2023, I felt the Lord had a word for JLC men—and many men responded:

> The Father is inviting men to intimacy through seasons of learning to walk in wisdom and grace to receive their full inheritance of manhood and authority—starting from enough.

- A few people said, "We need to do something. God is moving."
- Jared & I talked, outlined, and agreed on a mission: **Build a culture of manhood.**
- A small team (4i's) explored that mission for 10 months.

## Definitions

### What is Culture?
- The expression of values—both structural and organic
- The empowerment of people and the expression of values at every interface

### What is Ministry?
- To serve, protect, and develop both people & culture (values)
- When we protect values over people, we become Pharisees
- When we protect people over values, we promote idolatry

---

## What Are We Doing?

We are inviting men to become **wholehearted**—to love the Lord their God with complete alignment between their heart, soul, mind, & strength.

## If Men Walk Wholeheartedly...

*Responses from JLC staff:*

- **Family** — Men leading their homes well, spiritually and as protectors and providers. Laying down their lives for their wives. Cultivating an atmosphere of faith, hope, and love.

- **Kids** — Children raised with a living example of Godly leadership and intimacy with the Lord.

- **Youth** — Young men engaged, trained by their fathers and the culture of manhood. Teenage boys understanding true intimacy rather than the false intimacy offered by the world.

- **Young Adults** — Stronger leadership, a more potent atmosphere of faith, stronger conviction for intimate community.

- **Journey Life Church** — Overflow in our community and gatherings. Less meetings about messes, more meetings about dreams and visions. More declarations of God's goodness.

- **Outside JLC** — Men leading the charge in impacts—from their neighborhood, their workplace, every community they engage with.

## How Can You Impact This?

1. **Pray for us** — We need wisdom, discernment, and grace
2. **Join us** — Ask the Lord how you contribute
3. **Celebrate manhood with us** — Help us remove the counterfeit and restore wholeheartedness
4. **Point men to us** — Direct men into what we are building
5. **Equip us** — Your work equips the saints to do the work of ministry
6. **Talk to us** — Your ideas, needs, and influence matters
7. **Be patient with us** — Culture isn't built overnight; it has to be owned by the men

---

## A Prayer

> Holy Spirit—restore the hearts of men in our community. Pour out your spirit on our men that they might walk in the fullness you have declared over them from the beginning. Anchor their hearts in intimacy, identity, and integrity. Give them wisdom, humility, and courage to lead in their homes and their community. Let their character endure so that their trials would lead to fruitfulness. We ask for nothing short of heaven on earth because you've invited us to nothing less.

## Principles of Ministry

1. **Room For More** — Starting as a blank canvas to make room for God to raise people up

2. **Guiding to Intentionality and Intimacy** — The monthly meeting is a funnel to more intentional and intimate relationships

3. **Equip & Empower** — Declaring values, equipping men, challenging them to live more aligned

4. **Permission Granted** — If the Lord puts something on someone's heart, the default is "Yes, and let's see what is next?"

5. **Never Alone** — No solo missions. We prioritize building teams.

---

## Who Is This For?

**All men.**

- **The wounded and broken** will find connections; true wholeness comes from intentional and intimate relationships
- **Young men** will be trained up and have opportunities to be examples
- **The immature** (young and old) will be called up in kindness to build courage and character
- **Those mature in faith** will see a harvest of men genuinely interested in growing

And if we do this well, Holy Spirit has something for everyone.

## The Three Circles

### Culture Model
- **Weak Culture** — Values at center, but culture barely reaches the edge
- **Strong Culture** — Values at center, culture saturates everything

### Engagement Model
| Level | Expression |
|-------|------------|
| **Open** | Monthly Gatherings |
| **Intentional** | Small groups, Common interests, Bible Studies |
| **Intimate** | Discipleship, Boat Crews, Swim Buddies |

## What We Are Not

> We aren't weapons masquerading as strength. We aren't disconnected hearts disguised as toughness. We aren't absent and overworked professionals pretending we are on a mission.

## What We Are

> We are intimate lovers of God and sacrificial leaders of our family and community.
