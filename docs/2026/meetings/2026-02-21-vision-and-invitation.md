## Phase 1: What Is Ministry?

Opened with a conversational, interactive discussion: *What is men's ministry?* To answer that, we first had to unpack what ministry itself means.

Three perspectives surfaced:

- **Iron sharpens iron.** Ministry is something that sharpens you — takes you from dull to sharp, from ineffective to effective.
- **Teaching and learning.** Ministry is watching how someone lives their life, hearing their words, studying the Word — and then teaching others from that. It's bidirectional.
- **Direction.** Ministry gives you an update in your direction — going the same way, going the right way, course-correcting.

**Synthesis:** Ministry aligns us to godly things — the ways of God, the mind of God, the heart of God, the atmosphere of heaven. It takes us from misaligned to more aligned. When we say "men's ministry" or "kids ministry," we're saying we have compassion and focus toward a specific group. The way we teach, align, and prioritize is shaped by who we're serving.

## Phase 2: How Do We Connect?

Transitioned from definition to action: *What does it look like to have more compassion and alignment for men this year than last year?*

Bob spoke up with a practical question: "Why don't I have everybody's phone number? Why don't we have a way to connect with each other?" The room agreed — people wanted that.

**Key insight:** A passive contact list rarely drives real connection. Even if everyone exchanged numbers, the list alone wouldn't change much. The real need is something proactive — technology that reminds and nudges people to engage, share, and reach out between Saturdays.

This led to presenting an app concept that had been forming for a couple of months. The group's response was engaged. The conversation centered on: *How can we use technology as a tool to help us do the things we already know we want to do?*

*(App concept to be detailed separately.)*

## Phase 3: Personal Sharing

Opened the floor with broad questions:
- Share something about last year
- What are you heading toward this year?
- Why are you here today?

People went different directions with it — some reflected on last year, some on why they value men's ministry. A few highlights:

- One man took time to specifically thank Andrew for being faithful with this ministry. That was meaningful.
- Everyone, in their own way, articulated how important gatherings like this are.
- People were willing to be open, which set a strong tone for the year.

## Phase 4: Invitation to Grow

Closed with an invitation: men's ministry doesn't have to be just sitting in a circle on Saturday. It has the ability to scale to whatever people are passionate about.

**Standing principle:** Men's ministry isn't what happens on Saturday — it's what is amplified because we meet on Saturday. Saturday is once a month. The weeks between are where the real work happens.

**Open invitations shared:**
- If someone wants to make breakfast for the guys — let's do it
- If someone wants to lead worship — the door is open
- Service projects — would love that
- Any of these just need buy-in and consistency from the people passionate about them

**Founding commitment:** At minimum, Andrew will create a space for men to gather. Whoever comes, we meet. We sharpen. We encourage more connection outside of Saturday. We encourage more community aligned to the values of manhood we've outlined. Everything else grows from people stepping in.

## Notes for Next Man Times (March Issue)

- The "What is ministry?" conversation could be distilled into a short reflection piece
- Bob's question about connection is a real felt need — worth naming in the newsletter
- The app concept will be a tangible thing to announce or tease
- Personal sharing set a strong relational tone — consider how to carry that forward
- The "invitation to grow" framing gives language for encouraging ownership
