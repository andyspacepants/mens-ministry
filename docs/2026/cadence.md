# Men's Ministry 2026 Cadence

## The Monthly Rhythm

Each month follows a repeating pattern designed to build awareness, drive attendance, and create lasting impact.

### Week Before Meeting (Sunday)

**Location**: Church lobby - the funnel point where everyone enters the sanctuary

**Deliverable**: "Man Times" physical handout

Purpose:
- Announce the upcoming Saturday meeting
- Preview the month's value/theme
- Create anticipation and invitation

The handout should:
- Be visually compelling
- State the date, time, location
- Introduce the value we'll be exploring
- Include a personal invitation element

### The Meeting (Saturday)

**Default**: Third Saturday of the month
**Exceptions**: Second Saturday for June, November, December

Structure TBD per meeting, but anchored on:
- The month's value from the 10 Values of Manhood
- Not a sermon to consume, but a culture to build together
- February is unique: Vision & Invitation kickoff

### After the Meeting

- Follow-up communication (future: automated)
- Content posted to website/blog (future capability)
- Survey reminder for those signed up (future capability)

## The Advertising Commitment

> "I am going to work on better advertising the week before Men's Ministry."

This means:
1. Physical presence at church the Sunday before
2. "Man Times" handout ready and printed
3. Personal invitation and conversation at the stand
