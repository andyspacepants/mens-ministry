# Men's Ministry 2026 Vision

## The Problem

What we have right now isn't really a men's ministry. It's more like a monthly small group. We're sowing seeds, but we're not yet seeing the growth we're called to.

We don't want to become a monthly sermon that men only show up to consume.

## The Vision: A Culture of Manhood

We are building a **culture of manhood** at Journey Life Church.

**Culture** = how well we experience and express our values within our community.

A healthy culture is a consistent expression of our values at every internal and external interface:
- When you meet a JLC man individually, you experience the values
- When you're inside our church community, you experience the values
- When you meet a JLC man at his work and build a close relationship, you recognize a personal connection to the Lord

Men's ministry is one tool in the expression of our community to become a more thriving culture of these values of manhood.

## The Tagline

**"We're building a culture, not a crowd."**

We're not asking you to add another thing to your calendar. We're asking you to play your part in who we are becoming. Being a man isn't once a month, or once a week - it's every day all the time.

Men's ministry is where we declare, celebrate, and sharpen what it means to be a man, together.

## The 10 Values of Manhood

These values anchor our gatherings and lay the foundation of our culture. We aren't trying to memorize them - we want to live them so wholeheartedly that when people interact with us, at Journey, at work, in our community - they experience them.

| **Integrity** | I live with integrity no matter the cost |

### Leadership
| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Husband** | Sacrificial Love |

## 2026 Goals

1. **Mature how we serve** the men of Journey Life Church
2. **Mature how we invite** them to what we're doing
3. **Bring partners in** to lead alongside me (March onward)
4. **Build the measurement system** - men sign up, take monthly surveys, we celebrate growth publicly

## Leadership Model for 2026

- **February**: Andrew leads solo (Vision & Invitation)
- **March - December**: Andrew + one partner per meeting

This is part of the growth - not running everything alone.
